Sidebar extension for Firefox/Opera which displays your standalone Tasks IG instance in a sidebar. Includes a toolbar button which is supposed to open that sidebar but none of the supported ways works in Firefox.

Note:
* The extension is set to github's Tasks IG address by default, change the URL in options.
* For Chrome, it's better to just install the standalone Chrome extension. You still get Google Tasks access, but also Browser storage (synced and local).
