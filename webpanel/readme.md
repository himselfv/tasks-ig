Sidebar extension for Firefox/Opera which simply displays a given URI in a sidebar.

Includes a toolbar button which is supposed to open that sidebar but none of the supported ways works in Firefox.

Note that:
* For Chrome, it's strictly better to just install the standalone Chrome extension. You still get Google Tasks access, but also Browser storage (synced and local).
* The extension is set to github's address by default, right-click


To customize this extension to your own instance of Tasks IG:
1. Rename the ``manifest.json.example`` to ``manifest.json``
2. Replace the match address in manifest.json/content_scripts.
