Sidebar extension for Chrome and Firefox which simply displays a given URI (in this case Tasks IG) as a sidebar

Includes a toolbar button which is supposed to open that sidebar but none of the supported ways works in Firefox so it doesn't work.

To customize this extension to your own instance of Tasks IG:
1. Rename the ``manifest.json.example`` to ``manifest.json``
2. Replace the match address in manifest.json/content_scripts.

How to install the extension in your browser:
Depends on your browser. Firefox has temporary loading of extensions: open "about:debugging". To make the extension permanent you might have to register and sign it and whatever.
